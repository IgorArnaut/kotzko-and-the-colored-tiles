# Kotzko and the Colored Tiles #

The game is made as a project for a term paper in college. The game is about a guy who going trough a dungeon. The game is mainly inspired by a cutscene from Toby Fox' game Undertale, in which skeletons named Sans and Papyrus created a trap that involved tiles where each color added different effect to the player, for example red tile being impassable, but this time I have expanded these tiles a little more.

## Gameplay ##

One part of an top-down outer space dungeon, where you can use terminals, step on tiles which give you effects, open chests and open gates to go trough the dungeon.
The other part is a 2D sideview arena where you fight enemies and it is inspired by the battles in Tales games.

### Tiles ###

There are seven tiles and each of them causes its own effect on the player. They are:
* ðŸŸ¥ - can't be passed.
* ðŸŸ§ - puts effect that slows down the player and makes him oscillate into orange. It also kills the player when he enters the water.
* ðŸŸ¨ - puts effect that electrocutes the player, damaging him.
* ðŸŸ© - teleports the player into the enemy arena when he steps on it.
* ðŸŸª - puts effect that speeds up the player for a certain duration and makes him oscillate into purple.
* `#E65CE5` - puts effect that heals the player when walks on it.
* â¬› - oscilates between the black and white. Instantly kills the player when it is black, so the player has to walk on it while it's white.
* ðŸŸ¦ (water) - the player can swim on it, but it also electrocutes the player when he's near a yellow tile.
