# Kotzko and the Colored Tiles #

The game is made as a project for a term paper in college. The game is about a guy who going trough a dungeon. The game is mainly inspired by a cutscene from Toby Fox' game Undertale, in which skeletons named Sans and Papyrus created a trap that involved tiles where each color added different effect to the player, for example red tile being impassable, but this time I have expanded these tiles a little more.

## Gameplay ##

One part of an top-down outer space dungeon, where you can use terminals, step on tiles which give you effects, open chests and open gates to go trough the dungeon.
The other part is a 2D sideview arena where you fight enemies and it is inspired by the battles in Tales games.

### Tiles ###

There are seven tiles and each of them has its effect on the player.
